Paragrapher
===========

A simple text writer witten in c++.

Paragrapher is a small project created with the intention to make a simple, distraction-free writing space within the command line. The feature that distinguishes it from other text writes is that it saves to a text file after every new paragraph and prevents editing of previously-written paragraphs, forcing the user to focus on the paragraph at hand.

Paragrapher is written in C++, and is compiled and run with Cygwin.
